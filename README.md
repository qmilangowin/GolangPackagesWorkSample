## Golang Packages for import

Some of the packages I wrote for use at work. This is a very small amount and redacted and functionality removed where necessary so that no proprietary info/code is shared. 

### bdi-test-service
These ran as a side-car service in K8S
* RESTful micro-service for use with Qlik BDI service for test-automation purposes. 

### s3upload

automated upload service to s3 with command-line options to be used in a CI/CD pipeline.


### CloudRun Wrapper

Certain automated tests are running in CloudRun. This is a wrapper around some of the tests.
